# Socket-Programming-with-Encryption-and-Decryption-

•	Cooperated with one other classmates to design, develop and implement C to a program for network communication
•	Created User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for the server and client to easily communicate with each other
•	Implemented structs to initialize the server address by the port and IP and bind the socket descriptor to the server address
